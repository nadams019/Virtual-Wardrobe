# Mission Statement
The Virtual Wardrobe is a “Clueless” inspired website that allows users to organize, customize, and plan outfits. Users are able to visualize their wardrobe and bring it to life by using the different features available. Whether you are a fashion enthusiast or fashion newbie, The Virtual Wardrobe is able to help you find your style by taking the Aesthetic quiz. The user-friendly interface allows users to feel comfortable exploring their style and adventure into the different realms of fashion.
  
# Features
- Uploading items:
The user will be able to take a picture of their clothes (taken separately with a white background), and upload it to the website as an item.
- Organizing into categories:
The user can organize their items into categories based on clothing types (pants, belts, shirts, etc.), style (formal, casual, etc.), and weather.
- Matching recommendations: The Virtual Wardrobe is able to give recommendations based on previous selections by the user. The user can select what occasion the outfit will be used for and The Virtual Wardrobe will generate one clothing item from each clothing type.
- Aesthetic Quiz: The system will make recommendations based on the user’s pre-specified preferences. The quiz will include questions asking about color palettes, seasonal fabrics, occasion, etc.
